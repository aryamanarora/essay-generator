wortham ap art history 5 april 2019 essay practice two: colonialism  colonialism, the concept of controlling other places politically and exploiting them for their own benefit, is a huge part of world history and how current nations formed
many contemporary artists are interested in and want to create artwork that reflects the legacy and influence of colonialism
pisupo lua afe (corned beef 2000) is a work of art made by michael tuffery in 1994 that depicts an actual-sized cow
it’s made of aluminum cans which are labeled “corned beef” and connected together
they represent the importingation of corned beef to new zealand and other islands of the pacific
the medium corned beef cans and the shape they create shows the detrimental effects of colonialism in new zealand
michael tuffery, a polynesian artist, used corned beef because of the impact it had on new zealand during their colonial era
the introduction of this food led to a loss of culture and heritage in new zealand
moreover, obesity rates as well as other issues exponentially increased due to the unhealthiness of the canned meat
pisupo is a term used by pacific islanders to call canned food during the colonial period, hence the appearance of the name in the title
the depictions of a life-like cow refers to the introduction of cattle to new zealand
before colonialism, cattle was not a native species to new zealand
these animals hurt the brittle ecology, evident by the change in topography and balance of species in new zealand
the sharp and hard-edged bull shows that tuffery wanted to comment on the unhealthiness of the corned beef
in conclusion, the utilization of corned beef cans and the bull shape reflect the impact colonialism had on new zealand
corned beef may have brought a surplus of food, but the dangerous effects heavily outweighed the positive
the shape of the cow represents the connection to how cattle influenced new zealand in various ways
we often see that colonialism hurt the colonized in terms of physical and economic abuse like slavery, but works of art like these remind historians that there are more effects that need to be recognized and understood
excellent introduction and identification strong discussion of bull imagery as it relates to colonial legacy
good, but too brief discussion of use of corned beef cans as material choice, paired with strong description of colonial legacy
you might consider more descriptive discussion of material choices made by artists
excellent discussion of artist commentary
some discussion of context for material choices, but please review college board explanation of context below
