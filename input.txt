grant internship 20 march 2019 reflection #1 	interning at x-culture, an international business consultation startup headquartered at the university of north carolina greensboro (uncg), has introduced me to the effort needed in maintaining professional relationships, especially with colleagues who may have different cultural backgrounds from my own
in my team, comprised of other interns as well, there are no other americans
there are team members from romania, india, serbia, mexico, and argentina
naturally, we have different expectations from each other when working on consulting for our client, ogg, a business games and software company in brazil
despite these vast cultural differences, my relationships with my colleagues have been wonderful
for example, i have frequently worked with my colleague from india, rashi kangale, in researching potential international markets for our client
while working with her, i have learned how to use organization tools such as trello for project management as well as how to manage time zone differences
i have also become more informed about the culture of maharashtra, which is very different from my culture as a delhiite
the relationships i have made through this project have been extremely productive and brought me new insight about the impact of diversity on a workplace
my internship has been supervised by dr
vasyl taras, who is also an international business professor at uncg
the most important leadership quality that i have seen him express is communication
he is very involved in the work that high school student interns do, even though x-culture’s main consultants are graduate students and business professors
to interact with the network of interns that x-culture has hired, he holds weekly webinars and invites interns to discuss their experiences with him on that platform
furthermore, he sends weekly progress check-in emails to me to ensure my complete participation in my internship
this high level of involvement also facilitates teamwork, which is another major component of my work at x-culture
as an intern, i have demonstrated teamwork by collaborating with a team of six other interns to create a business plan for ogg solutions, a business game development company located in brazil
our main goal has been creating a detailed report that relies on fieldwork, research, and statistical simulation to determine the best course of action for ogg to expand beyond brazil and develop into a multinational corporation
to that end, we utilize modern global communication tools such as whatsapp and google hangouts and project management tools such as trello and google drive
in subteams, we work on different aspects of our client’s plan, such as marketing strategies and entry mode
my professional relationships have become robust due to this collaborative environment at x-culture
one way i could improve my relationships is by communicating my ideas more openly
by working with x-culture i have steadily learned that communication is the most important part of any collaborative effort; nothing can be accomplished until everyone on the team has a dialogue and arrives at an agreement for the next phase of the project
overall, interning at x-culture has introduced me to the nuances of professional relationships and the importance of communication between team members and colleagues in a collaborative workplace
i look forward to continuing my internship and working with a diverse team on our project

grant internship 24 march 2019 reflection assignment #2 	i have faced a few challenges in my internship for x-culture while working for my team’s client, ogg solutions
all of them fall under a single category: the inability of some team members to dedicate their full effort to our task
a serbian team member recently faced the loss of a family relative and has taken a break from our project while another member in romania was rushed to the hospital after a severe flu outbreak
these challenges, while frustrating, show the necessity of supporting one’s coworkers and being proactive in meeting deadlines in case of emergencies
in both cases, our team had managed to remain ahead of deadlines and so we were able to cope with such dire emergencies
challenges are natural; as the humorous yet often accurate murphy’s law states, “anything that can go wrong will go wrong
” as long as our team maintains a buffer zone between our current place in the project and our deadlines, challenges can be overcome
as a proactive measure, we decided to finish all our work at least a week before the official deadlines that our client ogg solutions agreed upon
challenges are not always negative; a good challenge in the workplaces can lead to increased productivity and fosters collaboration which may not happen when the work is too easy
as an example, the initial stages of our team’s project demanded limited involvement and so we rarely communicated face-to-face
however, as deadlines have begun to approach we have begun communicating face-to-face at least once a week, fostering greater collaboration and group involvement
the workload is now too great to be divided neatly between team members; instead, we form subteams to work on individual parts of the consulting project as well as appoint a coordinator to oversee the integration of those disparate parts in a final report
challenges are also necessary to gain knowledge and experience
before working in x-culture, i did not realize the importance of challenging work in maintaining involvement
in the early stages of the project, i was skeptical about my interest in the work but now i find myself fully invested into our team’s aims
challenges cannot merely exist, however
they must also be overcome
the most versatile tool to face the challenge of challenges is time management
as i mentioned before, our team focuses not on the distance of the deadline but on managing our time such that the deadline is not an issue that is dealt with at the last minute
another way to overcome challenges is collaboration
in deciding on our entry markets, we have frequently traded ideas and used constructive criticism to create changes in our proposed strategy for our client
for example, initially we thought our main market would be established universities in europe, but by researching and collecting data we found that south africa and india may also be potential markets for our client, which sells online business games that are meant to train future managers
without the input of different team members, the challenge of locating options for a market would not be overcome
these challenges have taught me the importance of communication and collaboration in a team; working on my own may result in a challenge being overcome, but working with a whole team will result in our final proposal going above and beyond the goals of the challenge that we face
my experience as an intern for the x-culture project has been a fruitful learning experience for me
it has given me increased appreciation for the challenges and conflicts that one faces in a job as well as shown me the importance of communication
one way i rose to the initiative of participating in this internship was by taking an active role as an organizer of my team
i coordinated all of the digital aspects of our work, such as communication through whatsapp (the primary medium of communication in colleagues’ home countries) and shared document management through dropbox and google drive
this was my niche in the team i was assigned to in x-culture, as we completed our assigned task of proposing a new market for the brazilian company ogg business simulations
i found that i have many strengths and weaknesses as i worked on this project with my colleagues
one of my strengths, i would argue, is compromise
during disagreements in my team, i tried to offer ideas that were agreeable to most of my colleagues
for example, i suggested portugal as our target market after disagreements over whether south american or western european markets would be better suited for our client’s entry
in the end, we all agreed on portugal since it combined the economic prosperity of the eurozone with the shared language and culture of brazil
another strength that i applied was coordination
tying into my role as an organizer and informal leader, i coordinates the different aspects of the report we assembled; we divided ourselves into subgroups based on our knowledge and fields of interest within international business and work on different parts of the report separately, which we brought together in a final report
in terms of how my work at x-culture accomplishes the professional development goals of this class, i would argue that it has been an eye-opening experience to the demands and challenges that a professional environment brings
one of the key goals of the course that i feel that this internship has been successful in is networking
the colleagues in my team span the globe, and my interactions with coworkers in india, romania, serbia, argentina, and mexico have resulted in professional contacts that i may benefit from having access to in the future
this internship has also helped me develop my professional communication skills
i learned, for example, that being too formal can inhibit useful interaction in the workplace
after all, if you do not interact with your colleagues informally at all, then there is no indication to your coworkers that you have any personal interest in your work
maintaining a balance between these kinds of formal and informal interactions is important in an internship or job
overall, i gained a great deal of valuable insight into the different aspects of a professional job, particularly the need to go beyond what one’s duties are and to show initiative
without showing initiative, busy supervisors will neglect to communicate with you and coworkers will feel that you are not a productive team member and thus exclude you
i believe that i have been successful in delivering this initiative at my x-culture internship
